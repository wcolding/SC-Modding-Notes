The game seemingly caches pointers to weapons at static addresses
If an AI unit on a map is using that weapon and the player does not have it in their loadout, these will point to the enemy's weapon
If the weapon is not loaded these will be NULL
Acquiring a weapon from a box will allocate a new weapon for the player and update the appropriate pointer

All addresses are offsets from the base address of the game ("conviction_game.exe")
